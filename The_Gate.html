        <h2>Proper Etiquette For Approaching The Gates</h2>
        <p>This chapter of the tome goes over how you should dress, act, speak, offer, and behave when you travel to The Gates Of Musphel.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Proper Dress:</h3>

        <p>When approaching the gates, proper attire must be worn at all times.</p>

        <p>One should always care to look their best when you embark on a journey to the gates.</p>

        <p>Formal attire in the native style from your region is easiest way to achieve this.</p>

        <p>Royal garb is highly cautioned, dressing in an overly expensive manner may come off as rude, or haughty.</p>

        <p>Because of this, those of higher social status should dress modestly, in attire you would go to a friends manor for tea, for example.</p>

        <h3>Show Respect to the Gates:</h3>

        <p>One must acknowledge that they hold no power they once thought they had, in the presence of the gates.</p>

        <p>You must always act in deference to the majesty of The Gates Of Musphel.</p>

        <p>Much like a King going to visit another nation's ruler, being aware of your standing is pertinent.</p>

        <p>Unlike a king however, no matter what standing you are of in the outside realm, in the presence of the gates, you are below everything.</p>

        <p>Should you act in a way unbefitting, you would be considered lucky if all that happened was being expelled from the gates.</p>

        <h3>Offerings:</h3>

        <p>Bringing a proper offering for the gates is of the utmost importance.</p>

        <p>As the gates do not interact with outsiders, save for those who make the journey to the gates, objects of material wealth are worthless.</p>

        <p>If you wish to leave the best impression possible, an object of history, or personal importance is required.</p>

        <p>Bringing an artifact from your nation's history is good, however you must be sure to study its origin and story surronding it.</p>

        <p>If you are unable to tell the tales and importance of your offering, it would be as if you were slinging mud upon the gates.</p>
